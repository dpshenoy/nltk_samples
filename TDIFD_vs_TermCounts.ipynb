    "# TFDIF (Term Frequency * Inverse Document Frequency) versus Term Counts\n",
    "### This is an example of how TFIDF provides a better idea of how important a term is to a particular document, by comparing its frequency across other documents in a corpus.\n",
    "### The corpus is the NLTK's corpus of 9 documents.\n",
    "### The particular document examined is text3, which is the Book of Genesis.\n",
    "### This example computes the TFIDF for both God and Jacob in the book of Genesis, and then compares them.  Theology aside, TFIDF argues for Jacob being particularly important to the Book of Genesis, arguably more important that God, given God's greater presence across the corpus."
